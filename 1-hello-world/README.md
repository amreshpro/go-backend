In Go projects, the `internal/`, `pkg/`, and `api/` directories serve distinct purposes, each contributing to the project's organization, encapsulation, and clarity. Here's a detailed breakdown of their roles:

---

### 🔒 `internal/` — Private Application Code

- **Purpose**:Houses packages that are **private** to your module

- **Go's Enforcement**:The Go compiler enforces that packages within `internal/` cannot be imported by code outside the module's root directory citeturn0search9

- **Use Cases**:
  -Business logic, helpers, or utilities not intended for external use
  -Components that may undergo frequent changes without affecting external modules

- **Example**:
  ```
  internal/
    auth/
      auth.go
    db/
      connection.go
  ```

- **Best Practice**:Place code here that you want to keep encapsulated within your module, ensuring a clear boundary between internal and external APIs

### 📦 `pkg/` — Public Libraries Intended for External Use

- **Purpose** Contains packages that are **intended to be used by external applications or modules*.

- **Community Perspective** While some developers find the `pkg/` directory useful for signaling public packages, others argue it's unnecessary and prefer flatter structure. citeturn0search7

- **Use Cases**:
   Utilities, SDKs, or libraries that are stable and well-documente.
   Code that you expect or intend others to import into their project.

- **Example**:
  ```
  pkg/
    logger/
      logger.go
    metrics/
      metrics.go
  ```

- **Best Practice** Only place packages here when you're confident in their stability and design, as they become part of your module's public AP.

---

### 🌐 `api/` — API Definitions and Interfaces

- **Purpose*: Organizes API-related definitions, such as protocol buffer files, OpenAPI/Swagger specs, and interface definitios.

- **Use Cases**:
 - Storing `.proto` files for gRPC servics.
 - Maintaining OpenAPI/Swagger specifications for RESTful APs.
 - Defining interfaces that describe the expected behavior of servics.

- **Example**:
  ```
  api/
    v1/
      user.proto
      user.swagger.json
  ```
